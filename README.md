# Ball-Tracker
A script that tracks tennis balls or any round object.


To run the script create virtual environment using the command ```python -m venv venvName```. Then to activate the virtual environment run the command ```venvName\Scripts\activate.bat```. Once the envrionment is activated, run ```pip -r requirements.txt``` to download all necessary libraries required for the project to run. All that's left is to run the script yourself!
